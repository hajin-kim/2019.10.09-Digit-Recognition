### DigitRecognitionModel.ipynb

    1. Get training datasets
    2. Make CNN model and traing
    3. Generate model file "DigitRecognitionCNN.h5"

### DigitRecognition.ipynb

    1. Get model file "DigitRecognitionCNN.h5"
    2. Get user image "target.png"
    3. Predict the digit of user image
    (Image filter codes are NOT included)

Created model file "DigitRecognitionCNN.h5" cannot be uploaded because of file size restriction.<br>
Please open and run "DigitRecognitionModel.ipynb" to generate model file.
